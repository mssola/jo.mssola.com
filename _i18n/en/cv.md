I have been the main contributor to these projects, and I have also been responsible for packaging and releasing them both as RPM packages and Docker images (by using [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/)).

## Contributions

### Mentor

I have been a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) mentor twice: once in 2014 with the [KDE](https://kde.org/) project, and then in 2016 with [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/).

### FLOSS

I have been involved in the maintenance of multiple free software projects, and I have also contributed to some of the dependencies of these projects. For example, I have contributed in some of the gems required by Portus such as [public_activity](https://github.com/chaps-io/public_activity), while also producing new ones such as [cconfig](https://github.com/mssola/cconfig) so the overall community can benefit from them.

I have also contributed to other projects such as Docker, with contributions in the [Docker distribution](https://github.com/docker/distribution) and  in the [Docker machine](https://github.com/docker/machine) projects, while also helping to maintain internal patches of Docker itself so customers could benefit from the latest security updates.

All in all, I am a staunch supporter of free software and I strongly believe that fostering communities around it is beneficial for society at large.
