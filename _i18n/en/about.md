## About me

Hello! I'm **Miquel Sabaté Solà** (yeah, [two
surnames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs)) and this is my

  28th, 1989.

  adopted as a [capelladí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capellades).
- The [FIB - Barcelona School of Informatics](http://www.fib.upc.edu/en.html)
  were nice enough to give me a **Bachelor Degree in Computer Science**.
- I'm currently studying **Catalan Language and Literature** at the [Universitat
  Oberta de Catalunya](http://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html).
- I have an unhealthy interest in way too many areas.
