* About me

Hello! I'm **Miquel Sabaté Solà** (yeah, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs][two surnames)]] and this is my personal
website. It's difficult to define oneself, but if I had to:

- I was born in [[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/48860][the bleak December]] 28th, 1989.
- Born and raised in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piera][Piera]], recently adopted as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capellades][capelladí]].
- The [[http://www.fib.upc.edu/en.html][FIB - Barcelona School of Informatics]] were nice enough to give me a
  **Bachelor Degree in Computer Science**.
- I'm currently studying **Catalan Language and Literature** at the [[http://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html][Universitat
  Oberta de Catalunya]].
- I have an unhealthy interest in way too many areas.
- A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software][Free Software]] enthusiast, developer and promoter.
- I do [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_containers][container thingies]] at [[https://www.suse.com/][SUSE]].
