        Master’s degree in Advanced Research in Humanistic Studies (<a href="https://www.urv.cat/en/" title="URV's site">URV</a>, 2023).
        I work as a Senior Full-Stack Software Developer at <a href="https://www.suse.com/">SUSE</a>, and I have contributed to numerous FOSS projects,
        acting as a mentor in the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" title="GSoC's site">Google Summer of Code</a>

        My main topics of research in humanistic studies are the textual criticism of unpublished authors of the catalan Baroque period and their contextualization.
        In particular, I have been working on the study of the life and literary works of Joan Terré Sarriera (1601-1640),
        a poet from the first period of catalan Baroque.

        I have also been involved in politics, being a member of <a href="http://viladecapellades.cat/">Vila de Capellades - CUP</a>.
        During the municipal elections celebrated in may 2019, I was nominated as councilor at Capellades.
        When forming up the government of the Town Hall, I was nominated as councilor of Youth, Citizen Participation and Transparency;
        which I later <a href="http://viladecapellades.cat/noticia/309/comunicat-de-vila-de-capellades-cup-en-relacio-a-la-sortida-del-govern">renounced in march 2023</a>.
        On the next elections, in 2023, I was reelected as a councilor, but remaining at the opposition this time.
